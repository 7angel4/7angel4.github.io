                    I'm <b>Angel Y. He</b>, a recent Computer Science graduate.
                    I did my Bachelor of Science (majoring in Computing and Software Systems)
                    at the University of Melbourne, and I'm currently studying the MSc in Advanced Computer Science
                    at the University of Oxford.
                    <br><br>
                    I am primarily interested in the intersection of <b>optimisation</b> (in a theoretical sense) and
                    <b>probabilistic/statistical programming and analysis</b> (especially <b>stochastic processes</b>).
                    I'm deeply motivated by the untapped potential of probability in computer science!
                    <br><br>
                    I've worked on projects (see <a href="academics.html">here</a>) ranging from theoretical
                    proofs to practical implementations. My undergrad research project was completed under the supervision of
                    the wonderful <a href="https://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mholmes1@unimelb/">Prof. Mark Holmes</a>
                    (Maaak) &ndash; initially as an undergraduate vacation scholar, and later on as a graduate research assistant.
                    <br><br>
                    I'd always be happy to collaborate and discuss research with others.
                    Feel free to contact me!
