                    I’m <b>Angel Y. He</b>, a DPhil student in the AIMS CDT at the University of Oxford.
                    I previously completed an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a
                    Bachelor of Science in Computing and Software Systems at the University of Melbourne.

                    <br><br>

                    My research is driven by the role of probability in computer science as a unifying framework
                    for <b>uncertainty, verification, and decision making</b>. I work on <b>formal and quantitative
                    verification of probabilistic systems</b>, particularly under epistemic uncertainty, with a
                    focus on <b>robustness and multi-agent interaction</b>.

                    Motivated by recent advances in AI, I am increasingly interested in <b>reinforcement learning
                    under uncertainty</b> and in bridging formal verification with learning-based methods, with the
                    aim of providing robust, formally guaranteed solutions for autonomous and multi-agent systems.

                    <br><br>

                    I have worked on projects ranging from theoretical foundations to practical tool development.
                    My undergraduate research was carried out under the supervision of the wonderful
                    <a href="https://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mholmes1@unimelb/">Prof. Mark Holmes</a> (Maaak),
                    initially as an undergraduate vacation scholar and later as a graduate research assistant.

                    Currently at Oxford, I am working with
                    <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david.parker/home.html">Prof. David Parker</a>,
                    focusing on robust verification of concurrent stochastic games.
