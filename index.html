                    I'm Angel Y. He, a recent Computer Science graduate.
                    I did my Bachelor of Science (majoring in Computing and Software Systems)
                    at the University of Melbourne, and I'm currently doing the MSc in Advanced Computer Science
                    at the University of Oxford.
                    <br><br>
                    I am primarily interested in the intersection of <b>optimisation</b> (in a theoretical sense) and
                    <b>probabilistic/statistical programming and analysis</b> (especially <b>stochastic processes</b>!).
                    I've worked on projects (see <a href="academics.html">here</a>) ranging from theoretical
                    proofs to distributed systems, and I'm deeply motivated by the untapped potential of probability
                    in computer science!
                    <br><br>
                    I'd always be happy to collaborate and discuss research with others.
                    Feel free to contact me!
