                    abstract="We present a computer assisted proof for a result concerning a three player betting game,
                    introduced by Angel and Holmes. The three players start with initial capital x,y,z&gt;0
                    respectively.
                    At each step of this game two players are selected at random to bet on the outcome of a fair coin
                    toss, with the size of the bet being the largest possible, namely the total capital held by the
                    poorer of the two players at that time. The main quantity of interest is the probability of
                    player 1 being eliminated (reaching 0 capital) first. Angel and Holmes have shown that this
                    probability is not monotone decreasing as a function of the initial capital x of player 1.
                    They conjecture that if x&lt;y&lt;z then player 1 would be better off (less likely to be eliminated
                    first) by swapping their capital with another player.
                    <br>
                    In this paper we present a computer-assisted proof of this conjecture. To achieve this, we
                    introduce the theoretical framework MeshItUp, and then perform a two-stage reduction to make
                    MeshItUp computationally feasible, through the use of mixed-integer programming."

                    Denote the players’ fortunes at each round as (Xₙ,Yₙ,Zₙ) ∈ ℕ³,
                    which evolves as a Markov chain. Write (X₀,Y₀,Z₀) = (x,y,z).
                    <br>
                    * Game 1: At each round, a giver and receiver are chosen at random.
                    The giver transfers the minimum of their fortunes to the receiver.<br>
                    * Game 2: Only a receiver is chosen each round to receive min(x,y,z).

                    Define the following terminology / representations:<br>
                    * Loser: First player to reach 0 (if tied in Game 2, pick one randomly).<br>
                    * Winner: First player to have all the money.<br>
                    * L(x,y,z): Probability that player 1 loses, given initial state (x,y,z).

                    The research problem addressed is the difficulty of attaining L(x,y,z) by hand.
