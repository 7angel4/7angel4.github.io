                    abstract="Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent,
                    strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for
                    these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires
                    transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world
                    settings. We introduce <i>robust CSGs</i> and their subclass <i>interval CSGs</i> (ICSGs), which capture
                    epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for
                    <i>robust</i> verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition
                    uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient
                    algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings,
                    the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the
                    PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a
                    selection of large benchmarks."

                    abstract="We present a computer assisted proof for a result concerning a three player betting game,
                    introduced by Angel and Holmes. The three players start with initial capital x,y,z&gt;0
                    respectively.
                    At each step of this game two players are selected at random to bet on the outcome of a fair coin
                    toss, with the size of the bet being the largest possible, namely the total capital held by the
                    poorer of the two players at that time. The main quantity of interest is the probability of
                    player 1 being eliminated (reaching 0 capital) first. Angel and Holmes have shown that this
                    probability is not monotone decreasing as a function of the initial capital x of player 1.
                    They conjecture that if x&lt;y&lt;z then player 1 would be better off (less likely to be eliminated
                    first) by swapping their capital with another player.
                    <br>
                    In this paper we present a computer-assisted proof of this conjecture. To achieve this, we
                    introduce the theoretical framework MeshItUp, and then perform a two-stage reduction to make
                    MeshItUp computationally feasible, through the use of mixed-integer programming."

                    abstract="Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent environments where decisions are
                    stochastic, strategic, and concurrent. Concurrent stochastic games (CSGs) capture these dynamics
                    but assume precise transition probabilities --- an unrealistic requirement in many real-world
                    settings. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) address uncertainty, but only in single-agent scenarios.
                    We introduce <b>uncertain CSGs</b> (UCSGs), the first verification framework that unifies CSGs
                    and RMDPs by combining transition uncertainty with multi-agent concurrency. We focus on the
                    subclass of <b>interval CSGs</b> (ICSGs), which model interval-bounded uncertainty. For
                    two-player ICSGs, we develop robust model checking and strategy synthesis algorithms across
                    finite- and infinite-horizon, zero- and nonzero-sum quantitative objectives.
                    Our implementation in the PRISM-games tool demonstrates that, in the zero-sum
                    setting, ICSG verification achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art CSG model checker
                    in PRISM-games, while in the nonzero-sum case the higher complexity underscores the intrinsic
                    challenges of robust multi-agent reasoning."
